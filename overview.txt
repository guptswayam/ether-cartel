1. The Ether Cartel app is for the dealers who are looking forward to selling their cars through Ethereum Blockchain.
2. For becoming the Dealer, Admin needs to create or approve the dealer.

############################## Plan Of Attack ############################
1. We need to use the Ownable Contract from openzeppelin for admin rights.
2. We need one Delaer Contract, which will contain the Dealers list, create Dealer and delete Dealer function.
3. We need one car Contract or Struct
4. We need one Showroom Contract, which will have all the functionalities for creating, selling and listing the car
